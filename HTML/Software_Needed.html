				<p class="title_text">Software Needed</p>

				<p class="text">There are thousands of differnt pieces of software that can be installed onto a PC, some of this is essential in order for the PC to operate and other software is installed depending on your needs. Below i have listed the essential software required.<b> Please Note -</b> New software is been released all the time, it’s always best to check for latest software on manufactures sites.</p><br>
			
				<!--Operating System-->
				<p class="item_title_text">Operating Systems</p>

				<p class="text">A PC requires an operating system in order to function. They are thousands of operating systems to choose from depending on your needs and experience. Without including Mac Operating systems the 2 common OS types are Microsoft Windows and Linux, below is a small breakdown of both:</p><br>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Windows_10_Screenshot.png" height="280" width="450">

				<p class="text"><b><i>Microsoft Windows</i></b><p>

				<p class="text">Windows operating systems are the most common in the world, almost everyone that has ever used a computer will have used a Windows OS at some point as found on most pre-built PCs you can buy off the shelf.</p>

				<p class="text">Windows is very user friendly for any experience levels, Windows 10 is the newest most up to date system. Updates tend to be pushed from Microsoft quite frequently to help keep your PC and data secure.</p>

				<p class="text">Windows is not a free operating system, you will require a product key to active the product and keep the operating system up to date with the latest security updates.</p><br>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Windows_7_End_Of_Support.png" height="300" width="450"><br>

				<p class="text">There are 2 ways of getting a product key officially, you can purchase a key on its own and download the software from Microsoft’s website, or you can purchase a disc which has the software loaded onto it and attached the product key.</p>

				<p class="text"><b>Please Note:</b> Windows 7 was a very popular Windows operating system although as of January 14 2020 Microsoft officially stopped support meaning no more security updates. It’s recommended no one uses Windows 7 anymore and upgrades to Windows 10.</p>

				<p class="text">Microsoft has provided a feature that upgrades any officially licensed versions of Windows 7 to Windows 10 for free by downloading the Media Creation Tool off Microsoft’s website. This is a very easy to use interface by simply clicking next on upgrade this PC.</p><br>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Linux_Mint_19.1_Tessa_Cinnamon.png" height="280" width="450">

				<p class="text"><b><i>Linux Systems</i></b><p>

				<p class="text">Linux is a very good alternative to Windows for both basic and advance users. Linux has thousands of different distributions which some are designed for specific purposes. For someone looking for a good alternative to Windows that is very similar Linux Mint is a very good choice.</p>

				<p class="text">Linux Mint is Debian based which has very large communities always improving the systems and providing great support. Linux Mint is very familiar to anyone that has used Windows and does not require any additional knowledge/experience to operate.</p><br>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Parrot_OS_Screenshot.jpg" height="270" width="450"><br><br><br>

				<p class="text">Best of all Linux if free open source software which means you can download and install on as many computers as you like and not need to pay for any licences. Linux also has a great range of free alternative software for all needs such as Libre Office rather than Microsoft Office, or Gimp rather than Adobe Photoshop.</p>

				<p class="text">Parrot OS is another great Linux operating system, this again is built on Debian but is mostly designed for penetration testing pre-installed with lots of great penetration tools. Although this is a great OS it’s designed for more advance users who know thier way round the terminal.</p><br><br>

				<p class="text"><b>For more information on operating systems please select either Windows, linux, or Mac OS from the operating Systems section of the above drop down menu bar.</b></p><br>

				<!--Driver Software-->
				<p class="item_title_text">Driver Software</p>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Device_Manager_Drivers.png" height="280" width="450"><br>

				<p class="text">A device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Drivers enable operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used. A device driver essentially allows smooth communication between a connected hardware device and the operating system.</p>

				<p class="text">Devices drivers now tend to automatically install themselves on new operating systems although you will find that sometimes if you install a new piece of hardware you may need to install the device driver manually. You will tend to see drivers automatically been installed when you connect a USB memory stick for the first time you will see a notification informing you its installing.</p>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Windows_Driver_Diagram.png" height="150" width="450"><br>

				<p class="text">You may need to use a disc that has come with some hardware such as with a graphics card, these discs contain the latest driver software when the device was manufactured making it quick and easy to install. You can also check the manufactures website for any newer drivers that can be downloaded free of charge.</p><br>

				<!--Office Software-->
				<p class="item_title_text">Office Software</p>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Microsoft_Office.jpg" height="310" width="450"><br>

				<p class="text">An office suit is also another crucial piece of software that will be required at times, it is best to install an office suit after you have finished installing your operating system therefore when you need a word processor or database software it will be there to use.</p>

				<p class="text">There are many makes of office suits available which most are cross platform (works on most operating systems. Some office suits are also free open source software whereas others come at cost.</p>

				<p class="text">I recommend installing Microsoft Office if you have installed a Microsoft Windows operating system, this is because Microsoft Office is also packed with features that make it easy to operate and run smooth when performing many office tasks.</p>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Libre_Spreadsheet.png" height="260" width="450"><br><br><br><br>

				<p class="text">Microsoft Office does come at a cost but is worth it in the long run especially with the rise in cloud storage you can store and edit your files within Microsoft One Drive seamlessly with your Office suit on your PC.</p>

				<p class="text">Libre Office and Open Office are great office alternatives both are open source and free to download and use. Some features are limited but are always been updated bringing in new features similar to Microsoft Office.</p><br><br><br><br>
