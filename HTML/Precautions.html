				<p class="title_text">Precautions</p>

				<p class="text">Before you take the plunge and begin to build your new PC, be sure to take note of the following precautions and advice as often building a PC without the correct precautions can be a painful and expensive experience.</p><br>
				
				<!--Electric Shock-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/High_Voltage.jpg" height="240" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Electric Shock</p>

				<p class="text">When working on your PC or any mains powered equipment always disconnect it completely from the mains wall socket and leave unplugged for at least 1 minute before touching any equipment to make sure the electric has fully discharged.</p>

				<p class="text">Never dismantle the PCs Power Supply Unit (PSU) because these units contain potentially lethal mains voltages, even when it is disconnected from the supply and if you accidently damage part of the internal it can be very dangerous if power back on. PSUs are not user repairable and only certified technicians should touch. It’s best just to replace the PSU with a brand new one if yours ever fails.</p><br><br><br>

				<!--Sharp Edges-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Sharp_Edges.jpg" height="220" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Sharp Edges</p>

				<p class="text">Beware of sharp edges on the corner of the PC case especially on the lower end cases they tend to very sharp as cheaply made. There are also sharp solder joints on the backs of the motherboards and other circuit boards where components have been soldered to the boards. </p>

				<p class="text">There is no harm in wearing a pair of anti-static gloves when building your PC if you tend to get cut very easily. Just make sure not to use Latex gloves as these can hold a charge and discharge when in contact with metal.</p><br><br><br>

				<!--Wiring Connections-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Molex_Cable.jpg" height="230" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Wiring Connections</p>

				<p class="text">Always make sure to completely disconnect the power before connecting or disconnecting any cables inside your PC. When connecting any cabling inside your PC make sure you are lining them up the correct way (normally the cables with only connect one way).</p>

				<p class="text">Make sure to use firm even pressure but never excessive force when connecting the cable, as most contain several small pins that can be very easily bent or damaged if connected incorrectly.  Molex connectors tend to be the most awkward due to all 4 cables connected to 4 separate pins that are not very secure in the connector plastic casing.</p><br><br>

				<!--Cleaning-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Cleaning_Precautions.jpg" height="350" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Cleaning</p>

				<p class="text">From time to time your PC will need cleaning both inside and out. You should never use any liquid detergents on your PC as these can damage the plastics on the PC case its best to use a damp cloth with just some clean water or with a little rubbing alcohol.</p>

				<p class="text">Never use water inside of your PC or on any of your components, if you do need to clean a component its best using rubbing alcohol as this vaporises at room temperature leaving no water particles which can corrode components.</p>

				<p class="text">For clearing dust you are best using some tins of compressed air to blow out any dust. It’s always best practice to unplug any fans before blowing out the dust from between your fan blades as when the fan spins it can generate electric which can damage your main PC components. Never use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum dust out as this can generate static electricity.</p><br><br><br><br>
