				<p class="title_text">Components Needed</p>

				<p class="text">There are many components that are needed in order to run a PC. Below I have listed the basic PC parts required to get the PC functioning. <b>Please Note -</b> New hardware is been released all the time, it’s always best to check for latest hardware on manufactures sites.</p><br>
			
				<!--Motherboard-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Motherboard.jpg" height="350" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Motherboard</p>

				<p class="text">The motherboard is the first component that you should look for as all other pieces of hardware attach to it. Once looking at a board in your price range you should then think about what other hardware you want to connect to the board such as how many hard drives you would like to install as each will require their own SATA port. If you are looking into multiple graphics card setups then you would need a board with multiple PCIe slots.</p>

				<p class="text">Some boards now also include other storage solutions like M.2 card slots allow for M.2 storage expansion cards to be added, these tend to be used for installing an operating system rather than on the main drive (known as the boot drive).</p>

				<p class="text">Also think of the actual size (form factor) of the board, this is important depending on the type of case size you are looking at mini ITX boards are used for very small PC builds, although the most common board size is a standard ATX board.</p><br><br><br><br>

				<!--Power Supply Unit (PSU)-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/PSU_1.jpg" height="250" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Power Supply Unit (PSU)</p>

				<p class="text">The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is the piece of hardware that provides power to the rest of the PCs hardware. There are many PSUs to choose with a varied price range. When choosing the correct PSU you should first consider what other hardware you want to install into the PC as you only get a limited number of power connectors on the PSU.</p>

				<p class="text">Most PSUs now give SATA and Molex power connectors as well as a standard 24 pin motherboard connector. SATA is used for hard drives and DVD drives, Molex power is now mainly just used for fans, lights, fan controllers, etc.</p><br><br><br>

				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/PSU_2.jpg" height="260" width="300"><br><br>

				<p class="text">Most PSUs on the market are pretty much the same physical size although there are PSUs that have been made for specific PCs for example Dell PCs in offices have custom PSU sizes due to the compact size.</p>

				<p class="text">For power rating I would recommend that you buy a PSU that gives at least 700 watts of power and has a least 3 Molex and SATA power connections. PSUs tend to have all their power adapters connected which can cause issues with cable management although you can pay a little extra and get a modular PSU in which you can connect what cables you want saving on space and easier to route cables.</p><br><br><br><br>

				<!--Hard Drive (HDD)-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Hard_Drives.jpg" height="350" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Hard Drive (HDD)</p>

				<p class="text">The hard drive is storage for all off your media and system information, there are many makes of hard drives on the market although there are only 3 types of internal hard drives which include a 3.5" hard drive mostly found a larger desktop PCs, a 2.5" hard drive mostly found in laptops, and a solid state drive (SDD) in which have no moving parts and are very quick therefore mostly used in expensive gaming PCs for the operating system and games library.</p>

				<p class="text">I would recommend for a desktop PC to have 2 hard drives a 240GB SSD drive is now fairly cheap and are great for installing your operating system on known as the boot drive, then have a 2nd larger 3.5” 2TB hard drive for your documents and media, etc.</p>

				<p class="text">It’s worth noting that you can get larger than 2TB hard drives although not all motherboards support the larger file structure so if you are thinking of by a drive more than 2TB you check the motherboard specifications first.</p><br><br><br>

				<!--PC Case-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Sharkoon_T9_Green.jpg" height="350" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">PC Case</p>

				<p class="text">The PC case is really up to you, there are hundreds of different styles on the market therefore you should have a price range and then look around the internet on more than one site comparing the model, case features and prices.</p>

				<p class="text">There are some considerations to be made when choosing a case such as the form factor of the case in which if you have chosen an ATX motherboard and PSU then you should only buy an ATX case not an ITX case.</p>

				<p class="text">Another consideration is the amount of racking inside the case which now varies on the case make/model. Older standard ATX cases tend to have around 4x 5.25" bays for DVD drives, fan controllers, etc and then would have around 5 3.5” bays for your 3.5” HDDs. It’s best to think of how many drives you are going to install in the future and go for the one that suits you the most.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

				<!--RAM (Random Access Memory)-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Random_Access_Memory.jpg" height="400" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">RAM (Random Access Memory)</p>

				<p class="text">RAM is where programs store information that they are using. If you don’t have enough RAM your programs will run much slower than they should. The RAM you can purchase is dictated by what the motherboard you have chosen supports.</p>

				<p class="text">Its best to check how many Dual In-line Memory Module (DIMM) slots your motherboard has, also check what memory type the motherboard supports most commonly now its Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) but DDR4 is becoming more popular due to the performance increase.</p>


				<p class="text">There are also many speeds available which again you will need to check your motherboard can handle. On older motherboards as standard they would have 2 DIMM slots although now a lot of boards have 4 to 8 DIMM slots, this means you can add more memory of the same time in the future.</p>

				<p class="text">If installing 2 or more RAM modules you should always install in matching pairs such as the same make/model and same speed checking your motherboard manual that you have connected each module to the correct DIMM slot. It’s now recommended to have a least 4GB of RAM in a PC but 8 or 16GB would be much better.</p><br><br>

				<!--CPU (Central Processing Unit)-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/AMD_Ryzen_CPU.jpg" height="320" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</p>

				<p class="text">The CPU is the brain of your computer which tells all of the other components in your PC how to operate after processing all the requests you are sending to the PC whilst you are using it think of even moving the mouse cursor needs to be processed by the CPU.</p>

				<p class="text">Almost all processors are multi-core, and quad-core meaning they are essentially multiple processors in one. When choosing a CPU compare specs and find a processor that has the speed that you will need to run the programs you want, also take into account power usage and ease of cooling.</p>

				<p class="text">There are two main CPU suppliers which are Intel and AMD, both companies make great products and there is no correct answer for which is best as both are very alike in performance now. You just need to make sure that your motherboard supports that CPU. AMD Ryzen processors are been used in many builds at the moment which work great.</p><br><br>

				<!--GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/GPU.jpg" height="320" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</p>

				<p class="text">A dedicated graphics card is essential for playing the latest PC games, video/photo editing or streaming, etc as they require more graphics processing power than normal. If you are building a PC for just general word processing or emailing, etc then dedicated graphics on the motherboard would be fine.</p>

				<p class="text">There are many different makes and models of GPUs which all vary in price and can be the most expensive piece of hardware within your PC depending on the make/model. Each graphics card also has its own RAM known as dedicated RAM. This also comes in different sizes normally 4GB would be the minimum you would need for a gaming PC now. </p>

				<p class="text">It’s worth also checking what outputs the GPU provides and make sure you have a monitor with that input. This is not too much of an issue as long as nearly all monitors and GPUs have HDMI or DVI on them now-a-days.</p><br><br>

				<!--CD/DVD Drive-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/DVD_Drive.jpg" height="240" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">CD / DVD Drive</p>

				<p class="text">A CD/DVD drive is not really needed that much now-a-days as most software is downloaded from the internet or can easily be put on a USB stick although if you have space inside your PC case and have an available power and SATA cable its definitely worth buying a DVD drive.</p>

				<p class="text">I recommend that you buy only a cheap DVD drive if you are not going to be using the computers DVD drive a lot, you can buy Samsung drives for around £15 which work great for installing software, playing DVDs, and playing your music CDs. Although if you are going to be using the drive a lot then you may want to pay extra for a better quality and faster drive.</p><br><br>

				<!--Computer Fans-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Case_Fans.jpg" height="320" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">Computer Fans</p>

				<p class="text">It’s worth when buying your parts you have some budget left for a couple of extra case fans. Although you already will have a fan on the GPU and CPU Heatsink it’s always best to have a least 1 exhaust fan at the back of the PC and potentially an intake fan at the front.</p>

				<p class="text">You will need to take into consideration the noise levels with the more fans you install but if you are doing a lot of gaming you will need the fans just to keep your PC from overheating and throttling slowing all your components down.</p>

				<p class="text">You can buy a whole range of fans from all different manufactures some are designed for quietness other more cheaper ones can be quite loud so i would recommend a fan controller for these to slow the speed down when not requiring that much cooling making them a bit quieter.  You can also get a whole range of RGB coloured LED fans to lighten up your case and also colouring changing fans.</p><br><br>

				<!--CPU Heatsinks-->
				<img class="item_image" src="..\Images/Heatsink.jpg" height="300" width="300"><p class="item_title_text">CPU Heatsinks</p>

				<p class="text">Although when buying most CPUs they will come with a stock heatsink with a standard fan assembly to help cool the CPU it is best buying a better quality heatsink if you are planning on gaming or video editing, etc.</p>

				<p class="text">Heatsinks come in all shapes and sizes and range in price. When searching for a heatsink you just need to make sure the heatsink you are looking at will fit in the case you have chosen. You may also run into an issue with the height of your RAM modules if your heatsink is very wide and low to the motherboard.</p>

				<p class="text">Be careful when opening a heatsinks packaging as you tend to find these already have thermal paste applied to the bottom which saves you having to buy thermal paste and then start applying although can be a right mess if you get it all over your hands and clothing.</p><br><br>
