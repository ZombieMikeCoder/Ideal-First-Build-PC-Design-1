				<p class="title_text">Windows OS</p>

				<p class="text">Microsoft Windows was announced by Bill Gates on November 10th 1983 a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, which had been introduced a couple of years earlier. Microsoft have realised a series of operating systems over the years each version includes a graphical user interface, with a desktop that allows users to view files and folders in windows. For the past 3 decades, Windows has been the most widely used operating system for personal computers PCs.</p><br>

				<p class="text">Microsoft Windows is designed for both home computing and professional purposes. Past versions of Windows home editions include Windows 3.0 (1990), Windows 3.1 (1992), Windows 95 (1995), Windows 98 (1998), Windows Me (2000), Windows XP (2001), Windows Vista (2006), Windows 7 (2009), Windows 8 (2012), windows 8.1 (2013), and the current Windows 10 was released on the 29th July 2015.</p><br>

				<p class="text">The first business-oriented version of Windows, called Windows NT 3.1, was in 1993. This was followed by Windows 3.5, 4.0, and Windows 2000. When Microsoft released Windows XP in 2001, the company simply created different editions of the operating system for personal and business purposes. Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and the current Windows 10 have followed the same release strategy.</p><br>

				<p class="text">Windows is designed to run on standard x86 hardware as well as x64, such as Intel and AMD processors. Therefore, it can be installed on multiple brands of hardware, such as Dell, HP, and Sony computers, as well as home-built PCs.</p><br>

				<p class="text">Windows 7 also introduced several touchscreen features, that allowed the operating system to run on certain tablets and computers with touchscreen displays. Microsoft's mobile operating system, Windows Phone, is designed specifically for smartphones and runs on several brands of phones, including HTC, Nokia, and Samsung.</p><br>		

				<p class="text">The current version of Windows, Windows 10, reintroduced the start menu (after been replaced by a start screen of tiles in Windows 8) and added the ability to run Universal Windows Platform apps in a window instead of always in full screen. Windows 10 was well-received, with many reviewers stating that Windows 10 is what Windows 8 should have been.</p><br>

				<p class="text">Windows 10 also marks the last version of Windows to be traditionally released. Instead, feature updates are released twice a year with names such as Creators Update and Fall Creators Update that introduce new capabilities; these tend to be released around May and October each year.</p><br><br>
